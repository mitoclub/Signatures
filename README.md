Games with mutational signatures
------------

## Plan
- use bootstraping (if there are no many mutspec samples)
- Check 1. Run sig extraction on normalized mutspecs and unnormalized and then normalize signatures of 2nd. After that compare signatures by cossim.
- Check 2. Run extraction on 2 mutspec datasets with **different normalization component** and compare results for normalized and not mutspecs. Signatures of normalized mutspecs must be more similar than for not normalized - result is obvious. Pass it
- Extract normalized signatures from different datasets

## Signatures Purpose
- Nature of mutagens
- Comparison of different mutspecs in terms of shares of different mutational processes
- Extraction of new signatures of mutational processes (long lived mammals, hot fishes etc.)
