Games with mutational signatures
------------

## Plan
- use bootstraping (if there are no many mutspec samples)
- Check 1. Run sig extraction on normalized mutspecs and unnormalized and then normalize signatures of 2nd. After that compare signatures by cossim.
- Check 2. I don't remember...
- Extract normalized signatures from different datasets


## Signatures Purpose
- Nuture of mutagens
- Comparison of different mutspecs in terms of shares of different mutational processes
- Extraction of new signatures of mutational processes
-
